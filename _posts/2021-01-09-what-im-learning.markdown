There are only so many things you can learn in a year. Here I plan to set what things I am learning this year as a long term goal. Topics are listed in order of priority in their sections.

## What I'm learning

Tech
* Go 
* Rust
* WASM
* Julia
* Vim

Academia
* Cryptography
* Machine Learning

Non-Tech
* Japanese

These topics I am saying NO to (outside of work). Maybe another time...

* Monitoring (Splunk, Datadog)
* React
* Angular
