This year I will keep weekly, monthly, and yearly goals, and write them down here. Pretty simple! Let's get started.

Yearly
2021:
* Learn Rust to the point I can say I am proficient
* Take at least one online course in machine learning
* Publish at least two open source projects that others can use and build on
* Figure out what my long term plan is education-wise

Montly
January:
-> At the time of writing, it's January 12th, and half of January has already gone by. I'll be building on what I've already started this month.
* Start a habit: recording daily activities in a time tracker (google sheets)
* Start a habit: Jump out of bed in the morning right when I wake up, no matter what
* Sharpen my investment portfolio, diversify and go for high risk high reward investables
* Finish the Rust Book, at https://doc.rust-lang.org/book (I can finish this if I do one chapter a day)
* Keep posting to twitter

Weekly
Week of January 10, 2021
